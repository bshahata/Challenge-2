<p align="left"> Here is a simple web page designed with my favorite colors with an avatar to match my physical appearance. A feature I love how hovering throught the menus it gives an after glow effect. I still don't have much of a portfolio so the <italics>About Me</italics> won't show anything yet. Hopefully through this bootcamp I'll be able to make updates with this website to truly make it alive. On top of that I will have more work to showcase.
