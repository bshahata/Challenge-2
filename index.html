     <h3>
       <q>One must keep working continuously; otherwise, one thinks of death.-Enzo Ferrari</q>
    </h3>
        <h2 id="About Me">A legendary quote from one of the most influential person in history. "Work" has many meanings, it can be a negative or a positive depending how you look at it. Hisotry and experiences are written through work. We remember icons like Salvador Dali, William Shakespeare, Aristotle, Leonardo da Vinci etc. not because of who they were or they're status but because of their work. That's the impact I hope to make when I embarg on my journey to becoming a fullstack developer.</h2>
